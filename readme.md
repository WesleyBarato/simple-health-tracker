# 🐞 Debugging Challenge: BMI Calculator

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a deliberately broken BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator created as a debugging challenge.

I designed this exercise to help developers practice one of the most important real-world skills: **reading, understanding, and fixing existing code** rather than writing everything from scratch.

The project simulates a common professional scenario where developers must identify issues across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript layers and restore a failing application.

## 🎯 Challenge Goals

Participants must:

* Identify and fix multiple syntax and logic errors
* Debug DOM interactions and event handling
* Correct the BMI calculation formula
* Restore layout and styling issues
* Apply structured commits describing each fix

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Vanilla JavaScript

No frameworks or libraries are used to ensure focus on core debugging skills.

---

## 🔎 What This Challenge Teaches

* Reading legacy or unfamiliar code
* Systematic debugging approaches
* Identifying cross-layer issues (UI + logic)
* Writing meaningful commit history
* Understanding cause vs. symptom in software errors

## 🚀 How to Participate

### 1. Fork the Repository

Create your own copy using the **Fork** button.

### 2. Clone Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/repository-name.git
```

### 3. Fix the Bugs Incrementally

Instead of solving everything at once, commit each fix separately:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: correct BMI calculation formula"
git push origin main
```

This mirrors how real development teams track changes.

### 4. Submit a Pull Request

Open a Pull Request describing:

* What you fixed
* Why the issue occurred
* How you solved it

## 💡 Why This Project Exists

Modern developers spend a significant amount of time debugging and maintaining systems rather than building greenfield applications.

This challenge was created to simulate that professional reality and strengthen problem-solving skills.
